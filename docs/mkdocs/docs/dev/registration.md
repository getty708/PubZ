## Validation
In this section, we are going to describe how to edit and apply validation rules in this application.
Validation rules for each field are described in [Model](./models.md). Please check it.


### Where should you write validation rules?
Pleas edit `dashboard/validators.py` to implement validation rules. The rules are expressed as function. For clarity, function names shall obey the following setting.

```python
def val_<field name of model/form field >_<short discription>(val):
	"""
	Returns.
	--------
	- <Detail discritption about values to be returned >
	"""
	# Rules here!
	return val_checked


# ----------------
def val_bibtex_title_en_replace_keywords(val):
	"""
	Return.
	------
    - Title string, some keywords are replaced with registerd format
    (e.g. Conference => Conf., International => Int'l.)

	"""
	# Write Validation Rule
	return title_checked
```

!!! Info
	Each rule function shall check a single rule, not multiple. If you want to apply several validation rules, you should divide the function and register them.
